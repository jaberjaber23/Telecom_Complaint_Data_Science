# Telecom_Complaint_Data_Science

"TelecomComplaintDataScience" is a GitHub repository that showcases the application of various machine learning algorithms in a real-world scenario. As a Junior Data Scientist for a telecom company, the goal is to evaluate the possibility of applying data science to the company's complaints data and demonstrate proof of concept. The repository contains the results of experiments using various machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression. The data was preprocessed using various techniques and the imbalanced data was handled using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). The repository also includes a comprehensive technical document that communicates the results and basic technical concepts to the management.
